**Add these 10 questions exactly:**

1. **What brings you here?** (Paragraph, Required)

4. **When you think about "well-being," what does that look like for you?** (Paragraph, Required)
   - Helper text: "There's no right answerâ€”describe a moment, a feeling, or even an image."

5. **Is there a tool, habit, or practice you've tried that's helped you? What made it workâ€”or not?** (Paragraph, Optional)
   - Helper text: "Anything counts, from journaling to walking to a favorite app."

6. **How do you prefer to give feedback?** (Multiple Choice, Required)
   - A quick note when something jumps out at me
   - Occasional check-ins

8. **Anything you wish people building tools for well-being understood about real life?** (Paragraph, Optional)

- **Confirmation message:** "Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us. We'll review your responses thoughtfully and be in touch within 2-3 business days. Your insights help us build tools that actually support real life."

5. **Save the Form ID** from the URL: `https://forms.google.com/d/[FORM_ID]/edit`

### Step 2: Create the Tracking Google Sheet

1. Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
2. Create new sheet: "PSYT Beta Survey Tracking"
3. Set up headers in row 1:
   - A1: Email
   - B1: Signup Date  
   - C1: Survey Sent
   - D1: Survey Completed
   - E1: Beta Score
   - F1: Priority Level

4. **Save the Sheet ID** from the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[SHEET_ID]/edit`

### Step 3: Set Up Google Apps Script

1. Go to [Google Apps Script](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Replace the default code with the content from `beta-survey-automation.js`
4. **Update CONFIG section** with your IDs:
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     SURVEY_FORM_ID: 'YOUR_FORM_ID_HERE',
     TRACKING_SHEET_ID: 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE',
     GMAIL_LABEL: 'psyt-beta-signups',
     FROM_EMAIL: 'info@psyt.ai',
     COMPANY_NAME: 'PSYT.AI',
     PRODUCT_NAME: 'The Brain'
   };
   ```
5. Save the project as "PSYT Beta Automation"

### Step 4: Connect Form to Sheet

1. In your Google Form, click "Responses" tab
2. Click the green Sheets icon
3. Choose "Create a new spreadsheet" (or select existing)
4. This creates the response collection sheet (different from tracking sheet)

### Step 5: Set Up Form Submission Trigger

1. In the **Form Response Sheet**, go to Extensions > Apps Script
2. Add this trigger function:
   ```javascript
   function createFormTrigger() {
     ScriptApp.newTrigger('processSurveyResponse')
       .forForm(FormApp.openById('YOUR_FORM_ID'))
       .onFormSubmit()
       .create();
   }
   ```
3. Run `createFormTrigger()` once to set it up

### Step 6: Configure Gmail Filters

1. In Gmail, create a new filter:
   - **From:** noreply@formspree.io
   - **Subject:** New submission from your form
2. **Actions:**
   - Apply label: `psyt-beta-signups` 
   - Never send to Spam
   - Mark as important

### Step 7: Run Initial Setup

1. In your Apps Script project, run the `setupBetaAutomation()` function
2. Authorize all required permissions
3. This will:
   - Create the Gmail label
   - Set up automatic triggers
   - Verify basic functionality

### Step 8: Test the System

1. Run `testBetaSystem()` to verify configuration
2. Submit a test to your Formspree endpoint
3. Check that:
   - Email gets labeled correctly
   - Survey email is sent
   - Response is logged in tracking sheet
